/**
 * The `Link object` represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the callerâ€™s ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.
 *
 * Unlike dynamic links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.
 *
 * For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a {@link https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#runtime-expressions runtime expression} is used for accessing values in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
